# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      Phase 3: Full Frontend Testing
      
      APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE:
      - Next.js 16 frontend with SQLite database (better-sqlite3)
      - All APIs implemented as Next.js API routes (not using FastAPI backend)
      - Database seeded with test accounts and sample content
      - EMERGENT_LLM_KEY configured in .env for AI chat functionality
      
      TEST ACCOUNTS:
      - student@aitutor.com / student123
      - teacher@aitutor.com / teacher123
      - admin@aitutor.com / admin123
      - content@aitutor.com / content123
      
      READY FOR TESTING:
      1. Login/Register flow with redirect to dashboard
      2. Dashboard with stats and quick actions
      3. Self-assessment module
      4. AI Chat with Socratic tutoring (EMERGENT_LLM_KEY enabled)
      5. Books/Videos/Quizzes libraries
      6. Admin content verification
      7. Progress tracking
      
      Please test all frontend functionality including the login redirect to dashboard.

      Backend API testing completed with 93.8% success rate (15/16 tests passed).
      
      ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY:
      - Authentication APIs (login/register/me) - cookie-based auth working
      - Self Assessment API - create/retrieve assessments working
      - Books Library API - 6 seeded books, filtering works
      - Quizzes API - 3 seeded quizzes, attempt submission with scoring works
      - Content Verification API - admin access working, no pending content
      - Dashboard Stats API - proper statistics returned
      
      ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE:
      - AI Chat API - Returns 500 error due to invalid OpenAI API key (EMERGENT_LLM_KEY)
      
      NOTE: Initial testing failed due to cookie domain mismatch between Python requests and Next.js server. 
      Resolved by using curl-based testing approach. All core functionality working except AI integration.
